<!--Answer to questions : 
When i added the link I noticed that the font size and tyoe has changed for the title, head, and h1 tags; 
also the background color has changed form full to ONLY half -->
<!--1. What changed? Why?
When i added the link I noticed that the font size and tyoe has changed for the title, head, and h1 tags; 
also the background color has changed form full to ONLY half , why ? I think because it is linked to the bulma file so it is using Bulma style instead.
2. Can we add Bulma styles on top of our existing styles? If yes, how? If no, why not?
I think it is possible to add Bulma style on top of the exsisting styles just as we tired in the homework , but it will change the appearance of the page. -->
